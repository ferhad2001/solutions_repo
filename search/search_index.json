The problem is straightforward: analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Yet, beneath this simplicity lies a complex and versatile framework. The equations governing projectile motion involve both linear and quadratic relationships, making them accessible yet deeply insightful. This study allows us to analyze key parameters such as initial velocity, gravitational acceleration, and launch height, which influence real-world scenarios like sports and rocket trajectories. 1. Theoretical Foundation Equations of Motion We derive the equations of motion using kinematic principles: Horizontal motion: [ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t ] Vertical motion: [ y = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] The time of flight is obtained by solving for \\( t \\) when \\( y = 0 \\) : \\[ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Thus, the range \\( R \\) is: \\[ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] The range depends on both the initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) and launch angle \\( \\theta \\) .

Conclusion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/","text":"Problem 3 Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth Motivation When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory is influenced by initial conditions (position, velocity) and gravitational forces. This is crucial for understanding orbital insertion, reentry, and escape scenarios. Key Concepts 1. Newton's Law of Gravitation The gravitational force \\( F \\) between two bodies is: \\[ F = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] Where: - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M \\) is Earth's mass, - \\( m \\) is the payload's mass, - \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of Earth and the payload. 2. Orbital Types Circular Orbit: For a circular orbit, the required orbital velocity \\( v_c \\) is: \\[ v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\] Elliptical Orbit: For elliptical orbits, the velocity varies. The semi-major axis \\( a \\) and eccentricity \\( e \\) determine the orbit's shape. The vis-viva equation is: \\[ v = \\sqrt{GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)} \\] Where: - \\( v \\) is the velocity at a distance \\( r \\) , - \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis, - \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of Earth. Parabolic Orbit: For a parabolic orbit, the velocity is equal to the escape velocity: \\[ v = v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] Hyperbolic Orbit: For hyperbolic escape, the velocity exceeds the escape velocity. The specific orbital energy \\( \\epsilon \\) is: \\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} \\] Where \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\) for hyperbolic trajectories. 3. Escape Velocity The escape velocity \\( v_e \\) at distance \\( r \\) is: \\[ v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] Where \\( r \\) is the radial distance from Earth's center. Numerical Integration of Motion The equations of motion under Earth's gravity are: [ \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = - \\frac{GMx}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} ] [ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = - \\frac{GMy}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} ] Where: - \\( x, y \\) are the payload\u2019s position coordinates, - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M \\) is Earth's mass. Applications Orbital Insertion : Requires velocity \\( v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\) . Escape : Achieved when \\( v > v_e \\) . Reentry : Occurs when the payload returns with insufficient velocity to maintain orbit. Conclusion The payload\u2019s trajectory depends on initial velocity and position. By applying these equations, we can predict orbital paths, escape conditions, and reentry scenarios.","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#trajectories-of-a-freely-released-payload-near-earth","text":"","title":"Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#motivation","text":"When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory is influenced by initial conditions (position, velocity) and gravitational forces.
