The first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the velocities needed for orbiting, escaping, and leaving a star system. These concepts are fundamental in space exploration. 1.

First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity) The first cosmic velocity \\( v_1 \\) is the velocity required for a stable circular orbit. The balance between gravitational force and centripetal force gives: \\[ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\] Where: - \\( v_1 \\) = Orbital velocity (first cosmic velocity) - \\( G \\) = Gravitational constant - \\( M \\) = Mass of the celestial body - \\( r \\) = Radius of the celestial body Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity) The second cosmic velocity is the same as the escape velocity, which we already derived: \\[ v_2 = v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] This is the speed required to escape from the celestial body\u2019s gravitational pull. Third Cosmic Velocity (Solar Escape Velocity) The third cosmic velocity \\( v_3 \\) is the velocity required to escape the gravitational influence of the entire solar system (or a star system). The escape velocity from the Sun's gravitational field is given by: \\[ v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_{\\text{Sun}}}{r_{\\text{Sun}}} + \\frac{2GM_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}}}} \\] Where: - \\( v_3 \\) = Third cosmic velocity - \\( M_{\\text{Sun}} \\) = Mass of the Sun - \\( M_{\\text{Earth}} \\) = Mass of the Earth - \\( r_{\\text{Sun}} \\) = Distance from the Earth to the Sun - \\( r_{\\text{Earth}} \\) = Distance from the Earth to the escape point 2.

This is crucial for understanding orbital insertion, reentry, and escape scenarios. Key Concepts 1. Newton's Law of Gravitation The gravitational force \\( F \\) between two bodies is: \\[ F = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] Where: - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M \\) is Earth's mass, - \\( m \\) is the payload's mass, - \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of Earth and the payload. 2. Orbital Types Circular Orbit: For a circular orbit, the required orbital velocity \\( v_c \\) is: \\[ v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\] Elliptical Orbit: For elliptical orbits, the velocity varies. The semi-major axis \\( a \\) and eccentricity \\( e \\) determine the orbit's shape. The vis-viva equation is: \\[ v = \\sqrt{GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)} \\] Where: - \\( v \\) is the velocity at a distance \\( r \\) , - \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis, - \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of Earth. Parabolic Orbit: For a parabolic orbit, the velocity is equal to the escape velocity: \\[ v = v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] Hyperbolic Orbit: For hyperbolic escape, the velocity exceeds the escape velocity. The specific orbital energy \\( \\epsilon \\) is: \\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} \\] Where \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\) for hyperbolic trajectories. 3. Escape Velocity The escape velocity \\( v_e \\) at distance \\( r \\) is: \\[ v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] Where \\( r \\) is the radial distance from Earth's center. Here's the equation written in proper Markdown with LaTeX formatting: Numerical Integration of Motion The equations of motion under Earth's gravity are: \\[ \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = - \\frac{GMx}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} \\] \\[ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = - \\frac{GMy}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} \\] Where: - \\( x, y \\) are the payload\u2019s position coordinates, - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M \\) is Earth's mass. Applications Orbital Insertion : Requires velocity \\( v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\) . Escape : Achieved when \\( v > v_e \\) . Reentry : Occurs when the payload returns with insufficient velocity to maintain orbit. Conclusion The payload\u2019s trajectory depends on initial velocity and position. By applying these equations, we can predict orbital paths, escape conditions, and reentry scenarios.","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#trajectories-of-a-freely-released-payload-near-earth","text":"","title":"Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#motivation","text":"When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory is influenced by initial conditions (position, velocity) and gravitational forces.
