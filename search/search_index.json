Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s equations of motion under the influence of gravity. Assuming no air resistance: The equations for motion in the horizontal and vertical directions are: [ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t ] [ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] where: - \\( v_0 \\) = initial velocity - \\( \\theta \\) = launch angle - \\( g \\) = gravitational acceleration - \\( x(t) \\) , \\( y(t) \\) = position at time \\( t \\) The time of flight \\( T \\) (when \\( y = 0 \\) ): [ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} ] The range (horizontal distance when projectile lands): [ R = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot T = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} ] This equation shows that the range is maximized when \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . 2. Analysis of the Range Dependence on angle: The function \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) is maximum at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) , meaning the range is longest at this angle. Influence of velocity: \\( R \\propto v_0^2 \\) , meaning that doubling the initial velocity quadruples the range. Effect of gravity: \\( R \\propto 1/g \\) , so on planets with lower gravity, the range increases. 3. Practical Applications Sports: Understanding projectile motion in soccer, basketball, or golf. Engineering: Designing ballistic trajectories for artillery or rockets. Astrophysics: Studying trajectories of celestial objects under gravity. 4. Implementation in Python Here\u2019s a simple Python script to plot the range vs. launch angle: 5. Discussion on Model Limitations No air resistance: In real life, drag reduces range. Uneven terrain: Real-world applications require adjusting for ground variations. Wind effects: Wind can alter the projectile\u2019s path. To improve realism, we could add drag force using numerical methods.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-foundation","text":"Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s equations of motion under the influence of gravity.
