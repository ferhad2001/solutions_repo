Equations of Motion Horizontal motion (no acceleration): [ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t ] Where: \\( x \\) is the horizontal displacement, \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle, \\( t \\) is the time of flight. Vertical motion (under acceleration due to gravity): [ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] Where: \\( y \\) is the vertical displacement, \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity. 2. Time of Flight The time of flight, \\( t_{\\text{total}} \\) , is the time it takes for the projectile to return to the ground (when \\( y = 0 \\) ): [ t_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} ] 3. Range The range \\( R \\) , which is the horizontal distance traveled before the projectile returns to the ground, is given by: [ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} ] This equation shows that the range depends on: - \\( v_0 \\) : the initial velocity, - \\( \\theta \\) : the launch angle, - \\( g \\) : the acceleration due to gravity. 4.

Orbital Types Circular Orbit: For a circular orbit, the required orbital velocity \\( v_c \\) is: \\[ v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\] Elliptical Orbit: For elliptical orbits, the velocity varies. The semi-major axis \\( a \\) and eccentricity \\( e \\) determine the orbit's shape. The vis-viva equation is: \\[ v = \\sqrt{GM \\left(\\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a}\\right)} \\] Where: - \\( v \\) is the velocity at a distance \\( r \\) , - \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis, - \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of Earth. Parabolic Orbit: For a parabolic orbit, the velocity is equal to the escape velocity: \\[ v = v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] Hyperbolic Orbit: For hyperbolic escape, the velocity exceeds the escape velocity. The specific orbital energy \\( \\epsilon \\) is: \\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{GM}{r} \\] Where \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\) for hyperbolic trajectories. 3. Escape Velocity The escape velocity \\( v_e \\) at distance \\( r \\) is: \\[ v_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}} \\] Where \\( r \\) is the radial distance from Earth's center. Numerical Integration of Motion The equations of motion under Earth's gravity are: [ \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = - \\frac{GMx}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} ] [ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = - \\frac{GMy}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}} ] Where: - \\( x, y \\) are the payload\u2019s position coordinates, - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M \\) is Earth's mass. Applications Orbital Insertion : Requires velocity \\( v_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\) . Escape : Achieved when \\( v > v_e \\) . Reentry : Occurs when the payload returns with insufficient velocity to maintain orbit. Conclusion The payload\u2019s trajectory depends on initial velocity and position.
