# Problem 1

# Key Equations for Projectile Motion

### 1. **Equations of Motion**
   - **Horizontal motion (no acceleration):**
     \[
     x = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
     \]
     Where:
     - \( x \) is the horizontal displacement,
     - \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity,
     - \( \theta \) is the launch angle,
     - \( t \) is the time of flight.

   - **Vertical motion (under acceleration due to gravity):**
     \[
     y = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
     \]
     Where:
     - \( y \) is the vertical displacement,
     - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

### 2. **Time of Flight**
   The time of flight, \( t_{\text{total}} \), is the time it takes for the projectile to return to the ground (when \( y = 0 \)):
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
   \]

### 3. **Range**
   The range \( R \), which is the horizontal distance traveled before the projectile returns to the ground, is given by:
   \[
   R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
   \]
   This equation shows that the range depends on:
   - \( v_0 \): the initial velocity,
   - \( \theta \): the launch angle,
   - \( g \): the acceleration due to gravity.

### 4. **Maximum Range**
   The maximum range occurs when the launch angle \( \theta = 45^\circ \), because \( \sin(2\theta) \) is maximized at \( \theta = 45^\circ \), giving:
   \[
   R_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0^2}{g}
   \]
   At this angle, the range is the greatest for a given initial velocity.

### 5. **Effect of Gravity**
   The range is inversely proportional to gravity. If we increase \( g \) (e.g., on a planet with higher gravity), the range decreases. If \( g \) decreases (e.g., on the Moon), the range increases.

   - On the Moon (where gravity is about 1/6th of Earth's), the range would increase by a factor of 6 compared to Earth, assuming the same initial velocity.

### 6. **Symmetry of the Range**
   The range is symmetric around \( 45^\circ \). This means:
   \[
   \sin(2\theta) = \sin(180^\circ - 2\theta)
   \]
   Therefore, the angles \( \theta \) and \( 90^\circ - \theta \) will result in the same range.
